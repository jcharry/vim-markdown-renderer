# vim-markdown-renderer
When you open a markdown file (either .md or .markdown), this plugin will automatically launch a browser window with a 
preview rendering of your markdown.

## Installation
1. Install the plugin with your favorite plugin manager. I.e. with Vundle...
  ```
  Plugin 'jcharry/vim-markdown-renderer'
  ```
2. This plugin uses a Node server to handle communication to the browser. After installing the plugin, you'll need to
   globally install the node server package
  ```
  npm install -g vim-markdown-renderer
  ```
